# EC2 Instance Types Summary

## Overview
- Instance types determine the hardware configuration of the host computer
- Each type offers different compute, memory, and storage capabilities
- Types are grouped into instance families
- Selection should be based on application requirements

## Instance Families

1. General Purpose
   - Balanced compute, memory, and network
   - Use cases: small/medium databases, web servers, code repositories
   - Types: Mac, T2/3/4, M, A

2. Compute Optimized
   - Higher CPU power
   - Use cases: batch processing, distributed analytics, media transcoding, high-performance computing
   - Types: C series, HPC

3. Memory Optimized
   - Fast performance for processing large data sets in memory
   - Use cases: memory-intensive workloads, in-memory databases

4. Accelerated Computing
   - Includes special hardware accelerators or processors
   - Use cases: graphics processing, data pattern matching, machine learning
   - Includes:
     - CPUs designed for deep learning workloads
     - Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGAs)
       - Use cases: genomics, data analytics, real-time video processing, financial computing
     - Instances for real-time video transcoding

5. Storage Optimized
   - Large amounts of storage
   - Use cases: NoSQL databases, data warehousing, Elasticsearch, big data analytics

## Exam Tips
- Understand that instance types determine hardware configuration and capabilities
- Know that types are grouped into families based on use cases
- Remember to select based on application requirements
- For associate-level exams, detailed memorization of instance types is not required
- Solutions Architect Professional exam requires more detailed knowledge of instance types

## Additional Note
- AWS documentation provides up-to-date information on instance types and their specifications
