Certainly! Here's an example of a backend API server in Python using the FastAPI framework with one REST method for returning "Hello, World!":

1. Install FastAPI and its dependencies:
   ```
   pip install fastapi uvicorn
   ```

2. Create a new file, e.g., `main.py`, and add the following code:
   ```python
   from fastapi import FastAPI

   app = FastAPI()

   @app.get("/hello")
   async def hello():
       return {"message": "Hello, World!"}
   ```

3. Run the FastAPI server using Uvicorn:
   ```
   python -m uvicorn main:app --reload --port 8080
   ```

Explanation:

1. We install the FastAPI framework and its dependencies, particularly Uvicorn, which is an ASGI (Asynchronous Server Gateway Interface) server that will run our FastAPI application.

2. In the `main.py` file:
   - We import the `FastAPI` class from the `fastapi` module.
   - We create an instance of the FastAPI application by instantiating the `FastAPI` class and assigning it to the variable `app`.
   - We define a route for the `/hello` endpoint using the `@app.get` decorator. This decorator specifies that the route should respond to GET requests.
   - We define the `hello()` function as an asynchronous function using the `async` keyword. This function will be called when a GET request is made to the `/hello` endpoint. It returns a dictionary with a key-value pair, where the key is `"message"` and the value is `"Hello, World!"`.

3. We run the FastAPI server using the Uvicorn server by executing the command `uvicorn main:app --reload` in the terminal. This command tells Uvicorn to run the `app` object defined in the `main` module (file). The `--reload` flag enables auto-reloading, which automatically restarts the server whenever changes are made to the code.

The server will start running on `http://localhost:8000` by default. You can access the `/hello` endpoint by making a GET request to `http://localhost:8000/hello` using a tool like cURL or by visiting the URL in a web browser. The server will respond with the JSON message:

```json
{
    "message": "Hello, World!"
}
```

FastAPI automatically generates interactive API documentation using Swagger UI. You can access the documentation by visiting `http://localhost:8000/docs` in your web browser. It provides a user-friendly interface to explore and test the available endpoints.

This is a basic example of a backend API server in Python using FastAPI. FastAPI is known for its simplicity, high performance, and automatic API documentation generation. You can extend this example by adding more routes, request parameters, request bodies, database integration, and other features as needed.
