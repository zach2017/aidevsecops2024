Install DJANGO

<pre>
 python -m pip install Django
 </pre>

Sure! Here's an example of a backend API server in Python using the Django framework with one REST method for returning "Hello, World!":

1. Create a new Django project and app:
   ```
   django-admin startproject myproject
   cd myproject
   python manage.py startapp myapp
   ```

2. Update the `myproject/settings.py` file to include the `myapp` in the `INSTALLED_APPS` list:
   ```python
   INSTALLED_APPS = [
       'django.contrib.admin',
       'django.contrib.auth',
       'django.contrib.contenttypes',
       'django.contrib.sessions',
       'django.contrib.messages',
       'django.contrib.staticfiles',
       'myapp',  # Add this line
   ]
   ```

3. Create a new file `myapp/views.py` and add the following code:
   ```python
   from django.http import JsonResponse

   def hello(request):
       return JsonResponse({'message': 'Hello, World!'})
   ```

4. Create a new file `myapp/urls.py` and add the following code:
   ```python
   from django.urls import path
   from . import views

   urlpatterns = [
       path('hello/', views.hello, name='hello'),
   ]
   ```

5. Update the `myproject/urls.py` file to include the `myapp` URLs:
   ```python
   from django.contrib import admin
   from django.urls import path, include

   urlpatterns = [
       path('admin/', admin.site.urls),
       path('', include('myapp.urls')),  # Add this line
   ]
   ```

6. Run the Django development server:
   ```
   python manage.py runserver 127.0.0.1:8080
   ```

Explanation:

1. We create a new Django project and app using the `django-admin` command and `manage.py` script.

2. We add the `myapp` to the `INSTALLED_APPS` list in the `settings.py` file to let Django know about our app.

3. In the `myapp/views.py` file, we define the `hello()` function that takes a `request` parameter and returns a JSON response using the `JsonResponse` class. The response contains a key-value pair, where the key is `'message'` and the value is `'Hello, World!'`.

4. In the `myapp/urls.py` file, we define a URL pattern for the `/hello/` endpoint and map it to the `hello()` view function.

5. We update the `myproject/urls.py` file to include the `myapp` URLs by adding `path('', include('myapp.urls'))` to the `urlpatterns` list.

6. Finally, we run the Django development server using the `python manage.py runserver` command.

The server will start running on `http://localhost:8000`. You can make a GET request to `http://localhost:8000/hello/` using a tool like cURL or by visiting the URL in a web browser. The server will respond with the JSON message:

```json
{
    "message": "Hello, World!"
}
```

This is a basic example of a backend API server in Python using Django. Django provides a powerful framework for building web applications and APIs, with features like URL routing, database ORM, authentication, and more. You can extend this example by adding more views, models, and URLs as needed.
